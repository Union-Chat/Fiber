# Nerve

Microservice to handle all internal communication between Union nodes, built with Elixir

## Why Elixir?

Erlang is a powerful language, extremely scalable and fault tolerant. As Nerve is the center of all Union operations,
this must be a strong piece of software

## Credits

The concept is heavily inspired from [singyeong](https://github.com/queer/singyeong), but adapted for our needs.
